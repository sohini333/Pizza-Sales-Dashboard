# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard
This is a analysis project made by me for learning purposes and performed fully on PowerBI. I also used SQL to cross check my results in PowerBI. Dataset for this project was taken from Kaggle and contained data for a year of pizza sales including the neccesary columns for analysis. End goal of this project was to build a dynamic dashboard where we can see all the KPIs' we would need to make wise data-driven decisions for the next year.
